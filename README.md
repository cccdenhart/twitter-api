# Twitter Simulation
This project simulates posting and retrieving tweets as the twitter application would do.

## To run: 
- run the 'generator' file in order to generate CSV files of random tweets and follower combinations
- Run the 'implementor' file to perform the simulation.  When running this file, follow the command line instructions to select a database type.

##  Project structure:
- generated CSV files are stored in the ./data directory
- results and instructions for both assignment versions are stored in the ./documents directory
